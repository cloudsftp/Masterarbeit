\hl{
    Although the established theory of non-linear dynamical systems is effective at describing physical systems and phenomena;
    the theory has been developed with a focus on smooth systems, limiting its use in certain applications.
    This limitation becomes apparent when attempting to model piecewise-smooth systems, such as electriconical systems that contain at least one switching element or mechanical systems with impacts.
    % Last sentence: just modeling?
    This thesis concerns itself with a model of a system that is piecewise-smooth, discontinuous and symmetric.
    The definition of this model is exceptionally complex, and exhibits a unique period-incrementing structure that is affected by multistability.
}
This thesis identifies the characteristics of the model that lead to this unique bifurcation structure by constructing \hl{an archetypal} model that exhibits the same bifurcation behavior.
It follows a description of the dynamics of the archetypal model and an explanation of the unique bifurcation structure using the description of the dynamics.
\hl{Additionally,} this thesis demonstrates that the proposed archetypal model can exhibit \hl{behavior leading to bifurcation structures that are} related to period-adding.
These structures behave unexpectedly.
And this behavior is explained by taking advantage of the symmetry in the archetypal and the original model.
In the same way, rules for these period-adding-related structures are derived.
