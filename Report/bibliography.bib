  optannote = {A class of piecewise continuous mappings with positive slope,
               mapping the unit interval into itself is studied. Families of 1-1
               mappings depending on some parameter have periodic orbits for most
               parameter values, but have an infinite invariant set which is a
               Cantor set for a Cantor set of parameter values. Mappings which
               are not 1-1 exhibit chaotic behavior in that the asymptotic
               behavior as measured by the rotation number covers an interval of
               values. The asymptotic behavior depends sensitively on initial
               data in that the rotation number is either a nowhere continuous
               function of initial data, or else it is a constant on all but a
               Cantor set of the unit interval. Stable URL:

  optannote = {In this paper a one-dimensional piecewise linear map with
               discontinuous system function is investigated. This map actually
               represents the normal form of the discrete-time representation of
               many practical systems in the neighbourhood of the point of
               discontinuity. In the 3{D} parameter space of this system we
               detect an infinite number of co-dimension one bifurcation planes,
               which meet along an infinite number of co-dimension two
               bifurcation curves. Furthermore, these curves meet at a few
               co-dimension three bifurcation points. Therefore, the
               investigation of the complete structure of the 3{D} parameter
               space can be reduced to the investigation of these co-dimension
               three bifurcations, which turn out to be of a generic type.
               Tracking the influence of these bifurcations, we explain a broad
               spectrum of bifurcation scenarios (like period increment and
               period adding) which are observed under variation of one control
               parameter. Additionally, the bifurcation structures which are
               induced by so-called big bang bifurcations and can be observed by
               variation of two control parameters can be explained.},
