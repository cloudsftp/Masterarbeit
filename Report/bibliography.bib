    optannote = {A class of piecewise continuous mappings with positive slope,
                 mapping the unit interval into itself is studied. Families of
                 1-1 mappings depending on some parameter have periodic orbits
                 for most parameter values, but have an infinite invariant set
                 which is a Cantor set for a Cantor set of parameter values.
                 Mappings which are not 1-1 exhibit chaotic behavior in that the
                 asymptotic behavior as measured by the rotation number covers an
                 interval of values. The asymptotic behavior depends sensitively
                 on initial data in that the rotation number is either a nowhere
                 continuous function of initial data, or else it is a constant on
                 all but a Cantor set of the unit interval. Stable URL:
