\section{Archetypal Model}
\label{sec:setup.arch}

\hl{
	This section introduces the result of this chapter, the archetypal model.
	It is the model of the last section slightly modified.
	The branches $f_\B$ and $f_\D$ are replaced with linear branches and the parameter $\alpha$ is negated in order to mirror the bifurcation structure along the $\beta$ axis.
