\section{Piecewise Hybrid Quadratic Model with Hyperparameters}
\label{sec:setup.quad.hybrid}

When looking at the cobweb diagrams in \Cref{fig:setup.quad.hyper.2.cobwebs}, one can see that the branches $f_\B$ and $f_\D$ are mostly monotonous.
Even when the branches are not, the stable cycles at these points only have points on the monotonously increasing part of these branches.
In this section, we will simplify the model of the previous section by replacing $g_R$, and therefore $f_\B$ and $f_\D$, with a linear function.
