In this section, the first model with similar characteristics to the original model is constructed.
This chapter only includes the constructed models on the ``good'' path.
\Cref{chap:app.models} lists other models that are not included in this chapter.

This first model has 4 branches that are all quadratic.
Hence, it is called the piecewise-quadratic model.
In the original model, the branches $F_\B$ and $F_\D$ are shaped more like cubic functions, but to keep the number of parameters reasonable, this model assumes only quadratic branches.
The model also has the same symmetry as the original model, and it is included explicitly in the model definition.
The state space of all constructed models is $[0, 1)$ instead of $[0, 2\pi)$ as in the original model.
