\section{Piecewise-quadratic Model}
\label{sec:setup.quad}

\hl{
	In this section, the first model with similar characteristics to the original model is constructed.
	This chapter only includes the constructed models on the ``good'' path.
	\Cref{chap:app.models} lists other models that are not included in this chapter.
}

\hl{
	This first model has 4 branches that are all quadratic.
	Hence, it is called the piecewise-quadratic model.
}
In the original model, the branches $F_\B$ and $F_\D$ are shaped more like cubic functions, but to keep the number of parameters \hl{reasonable, this model assumes only quadratic branches}.
\hl{
The model also has the same symmetry as the original model, and it is included explicitly in the model definition.
The state space of all constructed models is $[0, 1)$ instead of $[0, 2\pi)$ as in the original model.
