\section{Piecewise Quadratic Model}
\label{sec:setup.quad}

Now that we have analyzed the original model function and know its characteristics, we start constructing different models with similar characteristics.
In this chapter, we will only highlight the models on the ``good'' path.
Other models that we also examined are listed in \Cref{chap:app.models}.

We start with a model that is piecewise quadratic.
In the original model, the branches $f_\B$ and $f_\D$ are shaped more like cubic functions, but to keep the number of parameters low at the beginning, we model them as quadratic here.
The model has 4 branches and the same symmetry as the original model function.
We define the domain here as $[0, 1]$ instead of $[0, 2\pi]$.
