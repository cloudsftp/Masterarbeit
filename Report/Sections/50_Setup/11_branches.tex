\hl{
	This section is concerned with the overall shape and number of branches of the original model function.
}

\Cref{fig:setup.char.shape} shows the shape of the original model function.
\hl{One} can \hl{immediately} see that the \hl{model} function has 4 branches.
This is also evident from the model definition given in \Cref{sec:state.og.def}.
Also, we know from \Cref{sec:state.og.dynamics} that the model has \hl{the symmetry described by} \Cref{equ:state.og.sym}.
So the branches $F_\A$ and $F_\C$ are identical.
\hl{The same is true for} the branches $F_\B$ and $F_\D$.

There are no fixed points in the parameter regions \hl{that this thesis is concerned with}.
That means, the function is always larger than the bisector $y=x$.
Also, for the most part the \hl{slope} of the function \hl{is not steep}.
\hl{
	Meaning that the absolute value of the model functions derivative is below $1$ for a majority of the state space.
	A model where the absolute value of the derivative of its model function is below $1$ for the whole state space is called contractive.
	In such a model, every fixed point and cycle is stable.
