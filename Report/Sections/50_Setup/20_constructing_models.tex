\section{Constructing Models}
\label{sec:setup.models}

Now that we have analyzed the original model function and know its characteristics, we start constructing different models with similar characteristics.
In this section, we will only highlight the models on the ``good'' path.
Other models that we also examined are listed in \Cref{chap:app.models}.
