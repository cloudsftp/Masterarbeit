\section{Piecewise Quadratic Model with Hyperparameters}
\label{sec:setup.quad.hyper}

Now we will attempt to imitate the effects of the parameter $E_0$ on the branches $f_\B$ and $f_\D$ better.
Previously, we just varied $c_R$ which changes the values of the whole branches evenly.
Now, we only want to affect the value at the left borders of these branches.
For this, we introduce new parameters that are tied directly to characteristics of the model function.
