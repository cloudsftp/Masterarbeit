\section{Piecewise-quadratic Model with Composite Parameters}
\label{sec:setup.quad.hyper}

Previously in \Cref{sec:setup.quad}, the only varied parameters were $c_L$ and $c_R$.
Changing the parameter $c_L$ emulates the effects of $\chi_0$ on the branches $F_\A$ and $F_\C$ of the original model function well.
But changing $c_R$ does not emulate the effects of $E_0$ on the branches $F_\B$ and $F_\D$ very well.
This section introduces composite parameters that directly influence the characteristics of the branches $F_\B$ and $F_D$.
And the values of the parameters $a_R, b_R,$ and $c_R$ are not directly changed but calculated from those composite parameters.
