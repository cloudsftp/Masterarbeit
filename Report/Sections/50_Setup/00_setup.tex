\hl{
	This chapter is about the first task.
	Specifically, it is concerned with finding an archetypal model that exhibits the same behavior as the original model.
	First, it analyzes the original model and identifies its characteristics.
	After that, it lists different constructed models with different characteristics similar to the characteristics of the original model function.
	The behavior of these constructed models is analyzed as outlined in \Cref{chap:approach}.
