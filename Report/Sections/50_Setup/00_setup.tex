\chapter{Setup}
\label{chap:setup}

This chapter is about the first task at hand.
We want to find an archetypal model for the peculiar behavior of the original model.
For this, we first analyze the original model function and note the characteristics.
After that, we construct different models with different characteristics and analyze their behavior as outlined in \Cref{chap:approach}.
