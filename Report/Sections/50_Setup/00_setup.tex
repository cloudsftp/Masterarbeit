	This chapter is about the first task.
	Specifically, it is concerned with finding an archetypal model that exhibits the same behavior as the original model.
}
For this, we first analyze the original model function and note the characteristics.
After that, we construct different models with different characteristics and analyze their behavior as outlined in \Cref{chap:approach}.
