\chapter{Task}
\label{chap:task}

The task of this thesis is to find an archetypal model for the observed bifurcation structure in the original model.
For this we employ the approach outlined in \Cref{chap:approach}.
The result will be not only the archetypal model, but also the characteristics that are important for such bifurcation structures.

The next task is to analyze the archetypal model for two reasons.
First, we have to explore whether there are any behaviors that were missed in the preliminary investigation of the original model by \Citeauthor{akyuz2022}.
While doing this we also confirm that our archetypal model does not show any behavior that was not intended.
Secondly, we have to explain the bifurcation structure.

\todo{Better motivation. Are period-adding structures common in models of power converters?}
The last task is to explore the archetypal model further.
Period-adding structures can be observed in \gls{pws} discontinuous models, especially in models of power converters.
Therefore, explore the archetypal model especially for this type of bifurcation structures.
