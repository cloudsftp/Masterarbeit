\chapter{Task}

The task is to find a simplified model that exhibits the same bifurcation phenomenon as the original model.
That is chains of parameter regions with the same period cycles.
Where the parameter regions are alternating between ``type A'' and ``type B'', meaning single existence and coexistence as described in \Cref{sec:state.og.dynamics}.

\todo{Determine what characteristics are important}
\todo{Explain structures}
\todo{Check whether there was something missed in the original analysis}
\todo{Explore, what else can happen. Period-adding?}
