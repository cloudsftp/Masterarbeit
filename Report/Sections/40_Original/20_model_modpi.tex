\section{Reducing the Model to One Half}

\Citeauthor{akyuz2022} pointed out in their master thesis, that the model satisfies the property in \Cref{equ:yunus.property.symmetry}.
This means, that there is some symmetry in the model.
In the following, I will reduce the model to only $\theta \mapsto F(\theta) \mod \pi$ and observe what happens in the thin area explored above.
\begin{align}
    F(\theta + \pi) & = F(\theta) + \pi \label{equ:yunus.property.symmetry}
\end{align}
