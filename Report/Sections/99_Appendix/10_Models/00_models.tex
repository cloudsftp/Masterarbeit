\chapter{Other Constructed Models}
\label{chap:app.models}

This chapter is a collection of interesting looking 2D period scans of different constructed models that are not covered in the main part in \Cref{chap:setup}.
It does not cover all constructed models, but only those with interesting looking 2D period scans.
Also, the more detailed analysis, such as cobweb diagrams and symbolic sequences, is omitted in this chapter.
