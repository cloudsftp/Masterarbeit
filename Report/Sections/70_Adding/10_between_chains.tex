\section{Adding in Between Chains of the Same Period}

\Cref{fig:minrep.adding1.overview} shows both the periods of the model initially, as described in \Cref{chap:minrep}, as well as the model with period-adding structures.
For \Cref{fig:minrep.adding1.overview.adding}, only the values of the fixed parameters $a_L = 1, b_L = 0.5$ are changed.
Initially, the values for these parameters were $a_L = 4, b_L = -0.5$.
The only other fixed parameter $B$ stays the same and the parameter ranges of $p_x$ and $p_y$ are adjusted slightly in order to get the same bifurcation phenomena.
That means, that the shape of the function only changed on the branches $f_{\A}$ and $f_{\C}$.

When comparing both figures, we can see that there are no ``type B'' period regions in \Cref{fig:minrep.adding1.overview.adding}, the period-adding situation.
Instead, it looks like the ``type A'' period regions of the same period overlap now.
Also, the regions of higher periods in between the chains are new, these are the period-adding regions.
At the points, where these regions make a turn, there are parameter regions of even higher periods.
The meaning of these is explored in a later section, the next section will focus on the disappearance of the ``type B'' parameter regions.

\subsubsection{What Happens on the Path to Period-adding?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \begin{itemize}
              \item ``type A'' parameter regions stop overlapping with the ``type A'' period regions above them (lower period, same number of points on branches $f_\B$ and $f_\D$)
              \item Point where boundaries cross. On the left: no overlap, period-adding. On the right: overlap
              \item This point moves right, until no overlap exists anymore
          \end{itemize}
    \item \begin{itemize}
              \item ``type A'' parameter regions start overlapping with the ``type A'' period regions above right them (same period)
              \item Point where boundaries cross. On the left: overlap. On the right: no overlap, ``type B'' parameter region
              \item This point moves right, until no ``type B'' parameter region exists anymore
          \end{itemize}
    \item \begin{itemize}
              \item ``type A'' parameter regions stop overlapping with the ``type A'' parameter regions right to them (higher period, one more point on branches $f_\B$ and $f_\D$)
              \item This seems to happen in an instant
          \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Timeline:
On the parameter line outlined above, the processes happen as follows.
First, the process (i) starts.
While it is happening, the process (ii) starts and finishes, before (i) finishes.
Lastly the process (iii) starts and finishes directly.
After all that, process (i) is the last to complete.
