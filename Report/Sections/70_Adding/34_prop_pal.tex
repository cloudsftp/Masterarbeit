\subsection{Properties of the \Glsentrylong{pal} Structures in the Archetypal Model}
\label{sec:add.rules.pal}

With the revised algorithms we can now explain the \gls{pal} structures in the archetypal model.
We start by explaining why some cycles have a much higher period than expected in the \gls{pal} structures.
After that, we construct rules for the symbolic sequences in the \gls{pal} structures in the archetypal model.
And finally, we construct rules for the rotation-like numbers in the \gls{pal} structures in the archetypal model.
