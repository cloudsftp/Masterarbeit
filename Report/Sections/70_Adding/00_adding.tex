\chapter{Period-adding in the Archetypal Model}
\label{chap:add}

It was shown that there are period-adding structures in piecewise linear continuous increasing circle maps by \Citeauthor{simpson2018saw}.
He calls these types of functions skew sawtooth maps~\cite{simpson2018saw}.
The archetypal model function is not continuous, has four branches instead of two, and only linear on two of four branches.
But it is also a circle map, \gls{pws}, and mostly increasing.
\Cref{fig:add.saw.vs.arch} shows both maps for comparison.
In this chapter, we modify the fixed parameters of the archetypal model to produce period-adding structures.
The idea is to make the archetypal model function as similar as possible to a skew sawtooth map.
