In \Cref{fig:adding.period.whole} we can see different behavior at different points.
In the lower left and upper right quarters we see the same ``Type B'' parameter regions as in the original model \Cref{fig:yunus.2pi.2d.full} and in the minimal reproducing model \Cref{fig:final.period.whole.halved}.
In the lower right quarter, there seems to be period adding in between the chains and the ``Type B'' parameter regions no longer exist.
In the upper left quarter, there seems to also be period adding but perpendicular to the direction of chains.
``Type B'' parameter regions also don't exist here.
In the following subsections, we will take a closer look at each of those scenarios and confirm the hypothesis of this paragraph.
