\section{The Adding Structures}

We start by plotting the periods of stable cycles in a one-dimensional scan across a period-adding structure.
\Cref{fig:minrep.adding1.motivation.halved.1d.period.full} shows this scan, while \Cref{fig:minrep.adding1.corner.period.full} shows the period-structure.
The period range on the one-dimensional scan is marked in red between the regions $P_{10}^4$ and $P_{10}^4 \oplus P_9^4$.
The regions $P_{10}^4$ and $P_9^4$ have cycles as we expect, $\Cycle{\A^6\B^4\C^6\D^4}$ and $\Cycle{\A^5\B^4\C^5\D^4}$.
But the region $P_{10}^4 \oplus P_9^4$ is weirder.
In this region, there are two coexisting cycles, that act like the coexisting cycles in ``type B'' parameter regions.
They are hybrids of the cycles $P_{10}^4$ and $P_9^4$, $\Cycle{\A^6\B^4\C^5\D^4}$ and $\Cycle{\A^5\B^4\C^6\D^4}$, acting like one cycle on the one half of the model and acting like the other cycles on the other half.
This is the first sign, that there is something off about this period-adding structure.

Examining the one-dimensional scan of the period-adding structure, \Cref{fig:minrep.adding1.motivation.halved.1d.period.full}, closer we find some inconsistencies.
First, the period of the cycle $\sigma\rho$, 58, is larger than the periods of $\sigma$, 20, and $\rho$, 19, combined.
This is unexpected because the cycle $\sigma\rho$ should be the cycles $\sigma$ and $\rho$ glued together, and therefore its period should be exactly the sum of the periods of the cycles $\sigma$ and $\rho$.
Similarly, the period of $\sigma^2\rho$ should be the sum of the periods of $\sigma$ and $\sigma\rho$.
But instead, the period of $\sigma^2\rho$ is smaller than the period of $\sigma\rho$.
Is this not a period-adding cascade after all?

What is happening here is that a period-adding structure in the halved model manifests as this weird structure in the full model.
This becomes apparent when simulating the halved model in the same period ranges.
\Cref{fig:minrep.adding1.motivation.halved.1d.period.halved} shows the one-dimensional period scan in the halved model that corresponds to the scan in the full model in \Cref{fig:minrep.adding1.motivation.halved.1d.period.full}.
In the halved model, $\sigma$ is the cycle $\Cycle{\L^6\R^4}$, which is expected for the cycle $P_{10}^4$, and $\rho$ is the cycle $\Cycle{\L^6\R^4\L^5\R^4}$.
The cycle $\sigma\rho$ in between the two is now actually the two cycles glued together $\Cycle{(\L^6\R^4)^2\L^5R^4}$, as we would expect in a period-adding structure.
And its period is 29, which is the sum of the periods of the cycle $\sigma$, 10, and $\rho$, 19.

Now we can also see that the unusual hybrid cycles $P_{10}^4 \oplus P_9^4$ in the full model are the manifestation of the cycle $\Cycle{L^6\R^4\L^5\R^4}$ in the halved model.
This cycle is itself the first level of the real period-adding structure of the cycles $P_{10}^4$ and $P_9^4$, which are $\Cycle{\L^6\R^4}$ and $\Cycle{L^5\R^4}$ in the halved model.
\Cref{fig:minrep.adding1.large.adding} shows a one-dimensional scan of a full period-adding structure in the halved model at different parameter values that allow for larger period regions with higher periods, making them visible to us.
In the next section, we will explain what exactly the halved model is, why it works in our case, and how to translate symbolic sequences between it and the full model.

\subsection{The Halved Model}

The idea behind the halved model is that the model we have can be looked at in a different way than it was introduced in.
We know the model $m$ maps an input $x$ to $f(x) \mod 1$, meaning that if the output $f(x)$ is greater or equal to 1, we subtract 1 from it until it is in the range $[0, 1)$.
Similarly, we add 1 to it if it is smaller than 0 until it is in the desired range.
Now instead of confining the model to the domain of $[0, 1)$, we think of it repeating infinitely in both directions.
This proces is called lifting of circle maps and is described by \Citeauthor{devaney2021introduction} in his book~\cite{devaney2021introduction}.
We can achieve this by mapping $T^m: x \mapsto f(x - \lfloor x \rfloor)$.
This trick maps the input $x$ into the domain, on which our model function produces sensible results and causes it to repeat infinitely.
$T^m$ is now a lift of the model $m$ in the domain of all real numbers $\mathbb{R}$.
\Cref{fig:minrep.infinite.model.concept} illustrates this concept for the cycle $P_7^3$.
The blue square is the full model.
One can see, that the branch $f_\D$ is outside the blue square at its right edge.
This is because it was cut off and continued at the bottom of the square before, due to the $\mod 1$ operation.

\todo{this makes sense in the original problem domain}

In this model, there are no cycles that have multiple rotations.
Instead, the cycles that had multiple rotations in the full model, manifest as a sequence of different blocks of the full model.
Meaning for the example $P_7^3$, the same blocks of $\A^4\B^3\C^4\D^3$ are repeating infinitely.
But for an example with multiple rotations, such as $\A\B\C\D\A^2\B^2\C^2\D^2$, the blocks will not all be the same.
Instead, the blocks $\A\B\C\D$ and $\A^2\B^2\C^2\D^2$ will be alternating.

Now the symmetry of our function $f$ comes into play.
Since $f(x + 0.5) = f(x) + 0.5$ for $x \in [0, 0.5)$, we can split the infinite model into smaller blocks than the blue block of the full model.
The function of the infinite model repeats in blocks of size 0.5, these blocks are marked red in \Cref{fig:minrep.infinite.model.concept}.
These red blocks represent the halved model, it is the smallest repeating part of the infinite model $T^m$.
Basically we choose the smallest model, of which $T^m$ is a lift.
This happens to be exactly our model $m$ folded in half.
Se the halved model $h$ is defined on the interval $[0, \frac{1}{2})$ and maps $x \mapsto g(x) \mod \frac{1}{2}$, where $g(x)$ is the same as in our model $m$, defined in \Cref{sec:minrep.definition}.

To get the symbolic sequence of a cycle in the halved model, we look at the pattern in which different red blocks repeat along the infinite model.
For our example in the picture, there is only one red block that repeats infinitely, $\L^4\R^3$.
The next section will explain, how to translate cycles between the halved and full model.
