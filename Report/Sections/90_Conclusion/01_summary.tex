\section{Summary}
\label{sec:concl.sum}

This section summarizes all findings, it is divided into two logical parts.

First, the original model function and the parameter effects on the model function in the original model were analyzed.
Then, the characteristics of the model function and parameter effects that are needed for the \gls{pi} structure of interest were identified.
This is achieved by constructing the archetypal model, a model that is simpler than the original model and exhibits the same behavior.
This model has 4 branches $f_\A, f_\B, f_\C,$ and $f_\D$ like the original model.
And it is symmetric like the original model.
The branches $f_\A$ and $f_\C$ are quadratic and both governed by a function $g_L(x) = a_L \cdot x^2 + b_L \cdot x + c_L$, while the branches $f_\B$ and $f_\D$ are linear and governed by a function $g_R(x) = b_L \cdot x + c_L$.
One parameter of the archetypal model is chosen to directly manipulate a specific characteristic of the model function, namely the value of $g_R$ at the left border of the branches $f_\B$ and $f_\D$.
It is named $\alpha = -g_R\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)$ and its value influences the parameters $b_R$ and $c_R$.
Hence, it is called a composite parameter.
It has negative sign, to orient the \gls{pi} structure in the archetypal model like in the original model.
The other parameter is just the offset of the branches $f_\A$ and $f_\D$, $\beta = c_L$.

Then it was confirmed that this archetypal model exhibits the same behavior as the original model.
While doing so, the coexistence of four cycles which was not discovered previously in the original model was found.
And its existence in the original model was confirmed.
Also, the \gls{pi} structure of interest was explained using the characteristics that were found to be essential for the \gls{pi} structure.

Second, it was demonstrated that the archetypal model proposed in this thesis can also exhibit \gls{pa} behavior.
It was found that these structures defy the expectations for \gls{pa} structures, since the periods did not add up as they normally would and there were no obvious regularities in the symbolic sequences associated with the parameter regions in these structures.
Hence, they are called \gls{pal} structures.
Some parameter regions in these \gls{pal} structures are also affected by multistability like the ``type B'' parameter regions in the original and the archetypal model.
Then the halved archetypal model was introduced.
It was created by taking advantage of the symmetry in the archetypal model.
The same structures in the halved archetypal model exhibit the expected behavior of \gls{pa} structures and no parameter regions of these structures are affected by multistability.
With the help of this model, rules for the \gls{pal} structures in the archetypal model were formulated.
This includes rules for the periods, symbolic sequences, multistability, and rotation tuples associated with the parameter regions of these \gls{pal} structures.
