\subsection{Overlapping Periods}

When plotting the boundaries of the chains of parameter regions with the same period, we see that they overlap.
\Cref{fig:yunus.period.regions} shows the edges of regions of the same period when scanned from different directions.
The scan from left to right is colored in yellow, and from right to left in purple.
At most points, they agree with the corresponding scans from top to bottom in red and from bottom to top in blue, respectively.
When starting in an area of coexistence, blue, purple, yellow, and red show some disagreements.
This is apparent in the zoomed-in \Cref{fig:yunus.period.regions.zoomed}.
The reason is that in these regions of coexistence, the cycles sometimes start on one period and sometimes on another.
When the scans start in an area, where just one period exists, they agree for the most part.
There is another exception, that is the scans from top to bottom in red and from bottom to top in blue can't detect the ``teeth'' because they lose the cycles at an earlier edge.

We can also plot the boundaries of ``type B'' and ``type A'' parameter regions with a trick.
\todo{explain trick? (halved model) or leave this section out?}
\Cref{fig:yunus.halved.period.regions.zoomed} shows this for the zoomed-in scan from above.
You can see there that the ``type A'' and ``type B'' parameter regions overlap.
This means that there are parameter regions where there are 3 coexisting stable cycles, one from the ``type A'' parameter region and two from the ``type B'' parameter region.
