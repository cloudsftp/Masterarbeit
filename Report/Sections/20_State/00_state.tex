\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{chap:state}

In this chapter we will go over a brief introduction to the theory of non-linear dynamical systems, as well as \gls{pws} and even \gls{pws} discontinuous dynamical systems.
After that, we will introduce the model considered within the scope of this thesis.
