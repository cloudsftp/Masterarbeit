\chapter{Dynamics of the Archetypal Model}
\label{chap:dynarch}

This chapter analyzes the dynamics of the archetypal model that was defined in the last chapter in \Cref{sec:setup.quad.hybrid.definition}.
Its purpose is to confirm that his model really shows the same bifurcation structures as the original model.
The first section, \Cref{sec:dynarch.dynamics}, is an overview of the overall dynamics of the archetypal model.
The section after that, \Cref{sec:dynarch.bif}, takes an in-depth look at the bifurcations at the boundaries of the different parameter regions.
And finally in \Cref{sec:dynarch.bif}, we explore all the possible coexistence scenarios in the archetypal model.
