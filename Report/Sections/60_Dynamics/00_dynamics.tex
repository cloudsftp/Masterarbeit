\chapter{Dynamics of the Archetypal Model}
\label{chap:dynarch}

This chapter analyzes the dynamics of the archetypal model that was defined in the last chapter.
Its purpose is to confirm that his model really shows the same bifurcation structures as the original model.
The first section, \Cref{sec:dynarch.dynamics}, is an overview of the overall dynamics of the archetypal model.
The section after that, \Cref{sec:dynarch.bif}, takes an in-depth look at the bifurcations that are at the boundaries of the parameter regions.
And finally in \Cref{sec:dynarch.bif}, we list all the possible coexistence scenarios in the archetypal model.
