\chapter{Dynamics of the Archetypal Model}
\label{chap:arch}

This chapter analyzes the dynamics of the archetypal model that was defined in the last chapter in \Cref{sec:setup.arch.definition}.
Its purpose is to confirm that this model really shows the same bifurcation structure as the original model.
The first section, \Cref{sec:arch.dynamics}, is an overview of the overall dynamics of the archetypal model.
The section after that, \Cref{sec:arch.bif}, takes an in-depth look at the bifurcations at the boundaries of the different parameter regions.
And finally, \Cref{sec:arch.bif} explores all the possible coexistence scenarios in the archetypal model.
