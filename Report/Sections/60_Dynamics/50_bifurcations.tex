\section{Bifurcations}
\label{sec:dynarch.bif}
\label{sec:minrep.bif}

This section explores the bifurcations that happen at the borders of ``type A'' and ``type B'' parameter regions, respectively.
\Cref{fig:archdyn.dyn.regions.full} shows the borders of the parameter regions in full.
\Cref{fig:archdyn.dyn.regions.zoomed} is a zoomed-in version, that pictures the parameter region that contain the point $F_{16}$ of \Cref{fig:archdyn.dyn.period}.
It is a ``type B'' parameter region with the stable cycles $\Cycle{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$ and $\Cycle{\A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$.
Every one of its boundaries has a ``type A'' parameter region on the other side.
Therefore, we only need to describe the 4 boundaries of this ``type B'' parameter region in depth to cover all the boundaries of both ``type A'' and ``type B'' parameter regions.

\subsubsection{The Boundary $F_{16}^\uparrow$}
\label{sec:minrep.bif.U}

\Cref{fig:final.bifurcation.F.up} shows the bifurcation diagram of the first considered border, $F_{16}^\uparrow$.
The two existing stable cycles at the beginning are drawn in different colors to differentiate them.
The cycle $\Cycle{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$ is green and its rotated twin $\Cycle{\A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$ is red.
One can see that the green cycle collides with the border $d_1$ when it vanishes.
To be more precise the point $x_4^{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$, which is the 5th point of the cycle $\Cycle{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$, collides with the border $d_1$.
This bifurcation is denoted as $\BCB_{d_1}^{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$.
The same thing happens to its rotated twin, the red cycle at the border $d_3$ because of the symmetry.
Here, the point $x_{12}^{A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$ collides with the border $d_3$ and the bifurcation is denoted as $\BCB_{d_3}^{A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$.
In both cases, the cycles collide from the left side of the border, so for $\Cycle{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$, one point of the cycle on branch $f_{\A}$ collided with the border $d_1$.
And analogous, for $\Cycle{\A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$, one point of the cycle on the branch $f_{\C}$ collided with the border $d_3$.

The ``type A'' parameter region above is $\P_{\A^4\B^4\C^4\D^4}$.
The cycle $\Cycle{\A^4\B^4\C^4\D^4}$ (blue), which is stable in that parameter region, also collides with the same borders, the cycles $\Cycle{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$ and $\Cycle{\A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$ from the ``type B'' parameter region collided with, $d_1$ and $d_3$.
But here, two points of the same cycle collide with two different borders at the same parameter values.
Point $x_{4}^{A^4\B^4\C^4\D^4}$ collides with the border $d_1$ while point $x_{12}^{A^4\B^4\C^4\D^4}$ collides with $d_3$, both from below.
So one point of the cycle on the branch $f_{\B}$ collides with $d_1$ and one point on the branch $f_{\D}$ collides with $d_3$.
This is unusual for border collision bifurcations but is explained by the symmetry of both the cycle and the function.
The bifurcation is denoted as $\BCB_{d_1, d_3}^{\A^4\B^4\C^4\D^4}$.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Boundary $F_{16}^\downarrow$}
\label{sec:minrep.bif.D}

At the lower boundary $F_{16}^\downarrow$, the two cycles $\Cycle{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$ and $\Cycle{\A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$ also collide with the borders $d_1$ and $d_3$, this time from above rather than from below.
But while the cycle $\Cycle{\A^5\B^5\C^4\D^4}$ collided with the border $d_1$ at the upper boundary, it now collides with the border $d_3$.
To be more precise, the point $x_{12}^{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$ collides with the border $d_3$ meaning one point on the branch $f_{\D}$ collides with the border $d_3$.
Analogous, the point $x_{4}^{\A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$ of the cycle $\Cycle{\A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$ now collides with the border $d_1$ from above.
Meaning that one point of branch $f_{\B}$ collides with the border $d_1$. The bifurcations are denoted as $\BCB_{d_3}^{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$ and $\BCB_{d_1}^{\A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$.

The ``type A'' parameter region below is $\P_{\A^5\B^3\C^5\D^3}$.
The cycle $\P_{\A^5\B^3\C^5\D^3}$, pictured in blue, collides with the same borders, just like before at the upper boundary.
Again, two points of this cycle collide with two different borders, $d_1$ and $d_2$ at the same parameter values, but this time from below.
The point colliding with $d_1$ is $x_{4}^{A^5\B^3\C^5\D^3}$ and  the point colliding with $d_3$ is $x_{12}^{A^5\B^3\C^5\D^3}$.
So one point on the branch $f_{\A}$ collides with the border $d_1$ and one point on the branch $f_{\C}$ collides with the border $d_3$.
This bifurcation is denoted as $\BCB_{d_1, d_3}^{\A^5\B^3\C^5\D^3}$.

\todo{is the following paragraph fitting?}
It is as if the ``type A'' and ``type B'' cycles switched roles from the $F_{16}^\uparrow$ boundary to this $F_{16}^\downarrow$ boundary.
The cycles collide with the same borders, but the side from which they collide are swapped.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Boundary $F_{16}^\rightarrow$}
\label{sec:minrep.bif.R}

Now we will take a look at the horizontal boundaries of this ``type B'' parameter region.
At the right boundary $F_{16}^\rightarrow$, the two cycles $\Cycle{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$ and $\Cycle{\A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$ collide with the borders $d_0$ and $d_2$ from above.
These are different borders from before at the boundaries $F_{16}^\uparrow$ and $F_{16}^\downarrow$.
The first point of cycle $\Cycle{A^4B^4\C^5\D^3}$, $x_{0}^{\A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$ collides with the boundary $d_0$, while the point $x_{8}^{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$ from its twin cycle $\Cycle{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$ collides with the border $d_2$.
This means that one point of the cycle $\Cycle{\A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$ on the branch $f_{\A}$ collides with the border $d_0$ and one point of the cycle $\Cycle{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$ on the branch $f_{\C}$ collides with the border $d_2$.
The bifurcations are denoted as $\BCB_{d_0}^{\A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$ and $\BCB_{d_2}^{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$ respectively.

The parameter region right to this parameter region is $\P_{\A^5\B^4\C^5\D^4}$.
As before with the vertical boundaries $f_{16}^\uparrow$ and $F_{16}^\downarrow$, the cycle of the neighboring ``type A'' parameter region collides with the same borders as the cycles of the ``type B'' but from the opposite direction.
In this case, two of the points of the cycle $\Cycle{\A^5\B^4\C^5\D^4}$ collide with the borders $d_0$ and $d_1$ at the same parameter value from below.
To be more precise, the point $x_{17}^{\A^5\B^4\C^5\D^4}$, which is on the branch $f_{\D}$, collides with the border $d_0$ while the point $x_{8}^{\A^5\B^4\C^5\D^4}$, which is on the branch $f_{\B}$, collides with the border $d_2$.
This bifurcation is denoted as $\BCB_{d_0, d_2}^{\A^5\B^4\C^5\D^4}$.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Boundary $F_{16}^\leftarrow$}
\label{sec:minrep.bif.L}

At the left boundary $F_{16}^\leftarrow$, the two cycles $\Cycle{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$ and $\Cycle{\A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$ collide with the same borders as before, but this time from below.
The point $x_{7}^{\A^4\B^4\B^5\D^3}$, which is on branch $f_{\B}$, collides with $d_2$ while the point $x_{15}^{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$, which is on branch $f_{\D}$, colides with the border $d_0$.
These bifurcations are denoted $\BCB_{d_0}^{\A^5\B^3\C^4\D^4}$ and $\BCB_{d_2}^{\A^4\B^4\C^5\D^3}$ respectively.

The parameter region left to this parameter region is $\P_{\A^4\B^3\C^4\D^3}$.
Here again, the cycle of the ``type A'' parameter region collides with the same borders, as the cycles of the ``type B'' parameter region collided with, $d_0$ and $d_2$ from the opposing direction.
The point $x_{0}^{\A^4\B^3\C^4\D^3}$, which is on branch $f_{\A}$, colides with the border $d_0$ while the point $x_{7}^{\A^4\B^3\C^4\D^3}$, which is on branch $f_{\C}$, collides with the border $d_2$.
This bifurcation is denoted as $\BCB_{d_0, d_2}^{\A^4\B^3\C^4\D^3}$.

Just like with the vertical boundaries, $F_{16}^\uparrow$ and $F_{16}^\downarrow$, we can observe that the cycles seem to switch roles at the two boundaries $F_{16}^\rightarrow$ and $F_{16}^\leftarrow$.
