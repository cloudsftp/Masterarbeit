\chapter{Introduction}

In this thesis we will construct an archetypal model for a bifurcation scenario that was observed in a complex model.
This archetypal model should be a much simpler model than the original model.

\todo{Where does the original model come from? Power converter}
\todo{What kind of model is it? nin-lin, non-smooth, non-contin}

The topic of this thesis is rather part of the field non-linear dynamics than computer science.
The following chapter will therefore be a summary of fundamentals of non-linear dynamics used in this thesis.
